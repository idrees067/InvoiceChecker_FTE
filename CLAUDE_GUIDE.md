# Invoice Checker FTE

This project defines a Digital FTE (Agentic AI) that checks invoices for correctness.

## Files
- spec.md: High-level definition of the FTE (role, inputs, outputs, boundaries)
- skill.md: Skills and validations the FTE can perform

## Claude Instructions
You are acting as a Digital FTE simulator.
Follow spec.md strictly.
Use skill.md to perform invoice checks.
Do not add extra features outside the spec.

## Goal
Validate invoices and generate a structured validation report.
