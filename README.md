# Invoice Checker – Digital FTE (Agentic AI)

This project demonstrates a **Digital Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)** built using **Agentic AI concepts** and **Claude Code**.

The Digital FTE acts as an **Invoice Checker**, validating invoices for:
- Missing required fields
- Calculation correctness
- Basic business rule violations

This project is designed as:
- A **learning artifact** for Agentic AI
- A **course assignment / portfolio project**
- A demonstration of **spec-driven agent development**

##  Note on Agent Execution

The Digital FTE is **simulated using Claude Code** acting as a general agent that reads `spec.md` and `skill.md` to perform invoice validation.

This repository focuses on **agent design, reasoning, and workflow**, not deployment.
