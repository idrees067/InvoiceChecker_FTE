# Invoice Checker – Digital FTE (Agentic AI)

This project demonstrates a **Digital Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)** built using **Agentic AI concepts** and **Claude Code**.

The Digital FTE acts as an **Invoice Checker**, validating invoices for:
- Missing required fields
- Calculation correctness
- Basic business rule violations

This project is designed as:
- A **learning artifact** for Agentic AI
- A **course assignment / portfolio project**
- A demonstration of **spec-driven agent development**

## 📌 Project Structure

This repository follows a **spec-driven Digital FTE design**:

- `spec.md`  
  Defines **what** the Invoice Checker Digital FTE is responsible for, including goals, constraints, and expected outputs.

- `skill.md`  
  Defines **how** the Digital FTE performs invoice validation step by step, including checks and quality rules.

- `sample_invoice.md`  
  A sample invoice used to test and validate the Digital FTE.

- `CLAUDE_GUIDE.md`  
  Internal guide used when interacting with Claude Code as the general agent.

## 🤖 Note on Agent Execution

The Digital FTE is **simulated using Claude Code** acting as a general agent that reads `spec.md` and `skill.md` to perform invoice validation.

This repository focuses on **agent design, reasoning, and workflow**, rather than deployment or production infrastructure.
